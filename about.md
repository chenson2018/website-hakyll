## About Me

I am a second-year CS PhD student at Drexel University, advised by [Colin
Gordon](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~csg63/). My research interests are broadly in
Programming Languages. 

Some topics that I am currently interested in:

- category theory and its relevance to proof assistants
- functional programming with dependent types and effects
- the intersection of model theory and programming languages

Before coming to Drexel, I spent three years at Bank of America's Quantitative
Finance group in Atlanta. During this time I worked primarily with code related
to interest rate products and modernizing the department's DevOps
infrastructure.

For more details, see my [CV](/files/Henson_CV.pdf).
