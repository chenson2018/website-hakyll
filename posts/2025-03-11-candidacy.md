Today I successfully passed my doctorate program's candidacy examination! You
can view the document [here](/files/Henson_Candidacy.pdf). For Drexel's CS
program, our candidacy examination is done during our second year, with the
intent of creating a survey of existing work in a fairly narrow area. I selected
the intersection of category theory and proof assistants, a research direction
which I intend to further explore for the remainder of my PhD.

The paper is ***technically*** designed to be somewhat self-contained and
briefly reviews some categorical definitions, but in practice is too terse to be
considered introductory material. Still, it collects a good deal of information
that I have not seen together in exactly this format, so I hope that it can
serve as a helpful reference to others with similar interests. Please feel free
to reach out if you have any feedback or questions.
